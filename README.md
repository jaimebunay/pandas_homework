## A Whale Off the Port(folio)

--- 
In this homework I create an analysis jupyter notebook and use the Pandas Library to acomplish three tasks:
1. Read in and wrangle returns data. 
2. Determine success of each portfolio
3. Choose and evaluate custom porfolio. 

This repository contains a file with the code I used to conduct my quantitive analysis of portfolio returns. I have also included a Resources folder containing all the csv files I used for the purpose of this assignment.
